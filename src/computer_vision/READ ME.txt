Read me for landing_function

landing_function is a computer vision program which is capable of mapping a stable landing surface for the drone to
land. It can also map the area the drone will land on. The calculating the distance between obstacles and the drone's
landing area still needs to be successfully implemented. The program will also need to have its image resolution and
frame rate reduced to run on an Intel NUC

This runs on a Python 3.7 environment and uses the following libraries:
opencv
pyrealsense2
numpy
math
tkinter
pyransac3d
IntEnum
datetime
open3d

Important: This was developed on the side and is not a nessecary portion of the project. It was put on hold because other
aspects of the project have a much higher priority. It is strongly recommended to focus on having the drone swarm flying 
reliably with tracking before further development on this.
